#### ELECTRICITY TARIFF
####Loyality Program

Nordic Energy developed an electricity tariff with a loyalty program allowing every electricity customer to do micro investments into renewable energy generation facilities (REGF). Primary purpose of Nordic Energy Token (NGY) is a profit distribution coming out of those micro investments. NGY shareholders get their energy bills deducted by the shared profit automatically.  Each Nordic Energy (NGY) token represents one kilowatt-hour of consumed electricity. As consumption behaviors differ the amount of Nordic Energy ́s collected during a month is different as well. A single-family household with 3 persons for example might consume around 200 kWh of electricity and therefore collect 200 NGY token ́s per month. These token ́s can then be spent to purchase NGY tokens which in turn grants a shared profit of the REGF ́s profit. The micro investment mechanism works directly off the customers electricity bill. The NGY Tokens are native assets backed tokens which are based on the ERC-20 Token Standard. That means that they are compatible with the Ethereum Blockchain. However, as the public Ethereum Blockchain is not yet suited to handle small scale and high-volume energy transactions Nordic Energy developed the Fury Network – an open-source, Ethereum based blockchain specially designed for energy market needs. 
In contrast to platform approaches (e.g. putting a wind-mill on a platform and granting the members of the platform a share of the wind-mills profits) Nordic Energy does not act as a man in the middle. Yes, the REGF ́s are selected by us and yes we decide the amount of NGY tokens which are equivalent to the REGF ́s value. But once you buy NGY ́s you are the owner. So, we cannot revoke your access, your ownership and therefore your profit claim. We are no middle man because blockchain technology enables you to create your own energy generation portfolio .

#### SMART METER
#### 3 % Energy Savings on Avarage

As a remote-communicating digital electricity meter, they enable direct transmission of measured values to consumers, network operators,
energy suppliers and energy service providers. The consumer receives a precise visualization of his consumption behavior and sees every
"wasted" kilowatt hour. This can motivate him to energy-saving behavior. On the other hand, intelligent metering systems allow the
implementation of variable tariffs in which the consumer receives economic incentives to use electricity when it is cheapest. In addition,
intelligent measuring systems enable network operators to have a precise view of their power grid, enabling them to control generation and
consumption systems.


### ELECTRICITY POLICE

- End consumer: Transparency and efficiency increase through visualization.
- Electricity supplier: Optimization of procurement also needs recognition.
- Network operators: Higher operational reliability through data.
